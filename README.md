## Who will benefit from our project?
```
Nus Students and maybe others.
```

## Define what is the problem you are solving?
Thousands of basic requests are sent to nus teachers and offices everyday though some of the info can certainly be found on the nus website. This creates a wastage of time and effort of the teachers and offices even when the same question is repeated by different student. Hence, using NLP and modern messaging platform, this bot we are creating will be able to answer these requests and automatically respond to the sender saving time for offices and teacher to respond to more personal questions.

## Define user stories
Users want to know whether CS3217 is available next sem and the procedure to apply for it. Usually, users will go on IVLE or NUSmods to find out which might take a lot of time or even email the professors. Instead of doing this, users will just message the bot and all the info will be sent to user. Simple and fast. Definitely better than google.

## Does your proposed features make for a good Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
At first, for our MVP, we will just create a facebook bot that is able to handle requests about modules. Further info and database will be needed to scale the project but it provides a good environment to test the usersâ€™ experience and get their feedbacks.

Update 1: Basic requests about modules, classes, and location in NUS have been handled. Our next improved MVP will be able to search for teachers' info (eg. modules taught and email), and maybe bidding queries

Update 2: Bot is online with an online mongodb database.
          Requests about modules: classes, exam, description, cors history, lectures are handled.
          Requests about location inside and outside NUS are handled.
          Requests about professors' details and emails are handled.
          Reminder for CORS bidding is integrated.

## How you plan to achieve the end product through the remaining sprints:
We have the echo bot and the AI engine. Next step should be to connect them with nusmods api to get the modules database.

Update 1: Module database has been retrieved from nusmods and basic modules queries have been handle. By the next milestone, hopefully we can finish the MVP

Update 2: We are thinking of a new way of doing confessions. Users will be able to anonymously message any fb account through our bot. They can also broadcast the message to anyone who subscribed to our bot
## Draft out a clear plan for satisfying the Orbital requirements in terms of time contributed for the remaining sprints.
After finishing the MVP, we will test our bot with students from NUS. Only then we'll know what to do to perfect our product.

Update: We have already launch our test with the nus students. Bugs are identified and fixed everyday and we are intensively working on new features. I think we are on a good track
