# Orbital-Convenient Facebook Bot

# Who will benefit from our project?
Nus Students and maybe others.

# Define what is the problem you are solving?
Thousands of basic requests are sent to nus teachers and offices everyday though some of the info can certainly be found on the nus website. This creates a wastage of time and effort of the teachers and offices even when the same question is repeated by different student. Hence, using NLP and modern messaging platform, this bot we are creating will be able to answer these requests and automatically respond to the sender saving time for offices and teacher to respond to more personal questions.

# Define user stories
Users want to know whether CS3217 is available next sem and the procedure to apply for it. Usually, users will go on IVLE or NUSmods to find out which might take a lot of time or even email the professors. Instead of doing this, users will just message the bot and all the info will be sent to user. Simple and fast. Definitely better than google.

# Does your proposed features make for a good Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
At first, for our MVP, we will just create a facebook bot that is able to handle requests about modules. Further info and database will be needed to scale the project but it provides a good environment to test the usersâ€™ experience and get their feedbacks.

# How you plan to achieve the end product through the remaining sprints:
We have the echo bot and the AI engine. Next step should be to connect them with nusmods api to get the modules database.

# Draft out a clear plan for satisfying the Orbital requirements in terms of time contributed for the remaining sprints.
