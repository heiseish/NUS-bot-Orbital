In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"BMA5009","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]},{"ModuleCode":"BMA5524","ModuleTitle":"Applied Market Research","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleCredit":"4","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]},{"ModuleCode":"BMA5525","ModuleTitle":"Competitive Strategies For Smes And Startups","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleCredit":"4","Prerequisite":"BMA5009","LecturePeriods":["Friday Evening"]},{"ModuleCode":"BMA5801","ModuleTitle":"Management Communication","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleDescription":"designed to prepare students for effective communication at the workplace.

It will examine a variety of business-related networks. These include entrepreneurial networks of resource providers and alliance partners; networks of communication and coordination within established organizations; supply chain and marketing channel networks; informal networks in and outside organizations that confer influence and advance careers; cross-border networks for doing business globally. Managing in the contemporary global economy is much more about managing networks than hierarchical organizations through fixed chains of command. Both within organizations and between them, the paths to productivity, innovation, and success lie in astute networking. Network management and leadership demand different capabilities from those necessary to run a single firm or division within it. Communication, persuasion, collaboration, negotiation, emotional intelligence, flexibility, trust-building, reciprocity, and responsiveness are all essential. However, good network management requires more than “soft” or interpersonal skills. Given the complexity of business networks today, familiarity with the technical tools of network analysis can be very helpful as well. A highly technical science of networks now exists. Managers should learn how to use that science in analyzing and engineering their networks for superior performance. We will approach the problem of managing networks from two perspectives, “up” and “down.” “Up” refers to your vantage point as an individual actor, crafting your personal network, positioning yourself within it, and leveraging it for professional advantage and success. “Down” is your vantage point as an executive charged with responsibility for the functioning and success of the network as a whole; for example, within a division or functional area or a supply chain or distribution system.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-4-3","Lecturers":["James Russell Lincoln"],"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"]},{"ModuleCode":"BMU5001","ModuleTitle":"Leadership & Managerial Skills","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleDescription":"This course introduces concepts and principles fundamental to creating and leading effective organizations.

A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. On the other hand, probably all biological reactions occur in salty water. Water covers twothirds of our planet. At least to our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the ‘matrix of life’ which is not just a passive scaffold but also has many active roles in molecular biology. There are various scientific debates associated with water. For example, in the late 1960s, Russian chemist Boris Deryaguin and his colleagues claimed that polywater, a gel-like form of water, could be observed in small capillary tubes. Even more unbelievably, in the 1980s Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the ‘memory of water’, whereby the liquid water could allegedly be imprinted by biomolecular information which is now extensively used to justify homeopathy. In this module, we will explore how water, together with salts, shaped the emergence and evolution of life and also the students will have a full freedom to give your own opinions on the debates.

Many people may consider them to be in different regimes and require different mindsets to work on. But as both disciplines advanced, it became increasingly clear that the interactions between them are far more pervasive and fundamental than one might expect. For example, the field of biophysics has risen since the 1950s, and it has vastly changed how biologists look at living systems or study biology. It proved that the mindsets of biology and physics can join together to provide deeper insight into the phenomenon we call life. We will base the material on the basic laws of physics, and discuss how they are interwined with all kinds of life science and daily life phenomena, from cells to ecosystems and from Earth to outer space.

Competing explanations link these forms of violence to economic and political causes such as property rights, repression by political elites, and political competition between religious groups. We will study the micro foundations of culture, and critically examine the relationship between culture and inter-personal violence using some theoretical and mostly empirical literature. We will examine the efficacy of interventions such as legislative change, economic incentives, and civic engagement to alleviate these forms of violence.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-9.5","Types":["Module"],"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]},{"ModuleCode":"YSS3215","ModuleTitle":"Cognitive Psychology","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course introduces students to the study of how the mind works, seeking to understand how sensory information is transformed, stored, retrieved, or used.
