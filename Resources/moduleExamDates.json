A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6.

The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. On the other hand, probably all biological reactions occur in salty water. Water covers twothirds of our planet. At least to our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the ‘matrix of life’ which is not just a passive scaffold but also has many active roles in molecular biology. There are various scientific debates associated with water. For example, in the late 1960s, Russian chemist Boris Deryaguin and his colleagues claimed that polywater, a gel-like form of water, could be observed in small capillary tubes. Even more unbelievably, in the 1980s Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the ‘memory of water’, whereby the liquid water could allegedly be imprinted by biomolecular information which is now extensively used to justify homeopathy. In this module, we will explore how water, together with salts, shaped the emergence and evolution of life and also the students will have a full freedom to give your own opinions on the debates.

Ignore these principles we will be on a slippery slope to bad science. Violate these principles we will end up with ugly science. Students will learn about essential principles of scientific enquiry and why they are important in the acquisition of knowledge, and when they are ignored or violated, it will lead to bad and ugly consequences as had occurred in the real world. Students will learn what is meant by scientific, pseudoscientific, unscientific and non-scientific ideas. Student will learn to appreciate the strengths (and limitation) of scientific scholarship as well as respect nonscientific scholarship.

Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'.

These include a multitude of factors, such as legal considerations, the quantity of funding required and cost of capital depending on its source, and impact on shareholders and management etc. Corporations may also obtain finance by either levering existing assets or resorting to unsecured bank lending or bond issues. For the biggest corporations the most important source of finance tends to be the capital markets. These normally comprise the debt and equity markets through which public companies can offer securities to investors or to transfer the control of the company to new owners in the context of an agreed takeover, a hostile take-over bid, or of a private equity transaction. This course aims to develop a critical understanding of the subject matter through the combined study of finance theory, corporate law, capital market regulation and the corporate market dynamics, with a special focus on the different stakeholders involved in corporate finance. The module will focus on critical corporate finance issues such as: the use of debt and equity; why merge or acquire a business; core considerations of the process; purchase sale agreements and contractual governance; the role of the board of directors in an acquisition/financing transaction; the permissibility and regulation of takeover defenses in the UK, the US and the EU. It will also discuss cross-border IPOS, the problem of market abuse, theory and practice of corporate takeovers and their regulation, and issues pertinent to private equity transactions, as well practical issues relating to structuring corporate acquisition deals and attendant legal documentation.

It is meant for all who want to gain a better understanding of what is happening and concerns primarily (a) the way money is recycled through the banking system or the capital market, (b) the products and conduct of the banking, securities and investment industry in this recycling activity, (c) the risks that are taken in the financial services industry (primarily by commercial and investment banks in their different functions) and the tools of risk management, (d) the operation of the financial markets and their infrastructure, (e) the type of regulation of commercial banks and of the intermediaries and issuers in the capital markets, and (f) the objectives, role, shape and effectiveness of this regulation. In this connection, the course will also deal with the smooth operation of payment systems. Financial risk and its management is an important theme and the major concern in the course. What can commercial or investment banks and financial regulation achieve in this regard, how is risk management structured, and what academic or other (political) models are used in this connection, how effective are they, e.g. in the capital adequacy and liquidity requirements, and what can or must governments and/or central banks or other regulators do when all fails and financial crises occur? From a legal point of view, an important aspect is the strong public policy undercurrents in the applicable law. That is obvious in regulation but may also impact on private law. Another important issuer is that the law applicable to financial products and their regulation is ever more transnationalised and expressed at the international level, especially in terms of transactional and payment finality, financial stability, and even banking resolution facilities or international safety nets. In these circumstances, choice of national laws in the older private international law approach often mean little and it will be discussed how they may fall seriously short especially in in matters of regulatory oversight and bankruptcy situations.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","Preclusion":"LL4298V/LL5298V/LL6298V International Finance","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening","Monday Evening","Friday Afternoon"]},{"ModuleCode":"LL4309V","ModuleTitle":"The Practical Realities of Dispute Resolution in Asia","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"Litigation, Arbitration and Mediation are three forms of resolving commercial disputes.

These include a multitude of factors, such as legal considerations, the quantity of funding required and cost of capital depending on its source, and impact on shareholders and management etc. Corporations may also obtain finance by either levering existing assets or resorting to unsecured bank lending or bond issues. For the biggest corporations the most important source of finance tends to be the capital markets. These normally comprise the debt and equity markets through which public companies can offer securities to investors or to transfer the control of the company to new owners in the context of an agreed takeover, a hostile take-over bid, or of a private equity transaction. This course aims to develop a critical understanding of the subject matter through the combined study of finance theory, corporate law, capital market regulation and the corporate market dynamics, with a special focus on the different stakeholders involved in corporate finance. The module will focus on critical corporate finance issues such as: the use of debt and equity; why merge or acquire a business; core considerations of the process; purchase sale agreements and contractual governance; the role of the board of directors in an acquisition/financing transaction; the permissibility and regulation of takeover defenses in the UK, the US and the EU. It will also discuss cross-border IPOS, the problem of market abuse, theory and practice of corporate takeovers and their regulation, and issues pertinent to private equity transactions, as well practical issues relating to structuring corporate acquisition deals and attendant legal documentation.

It is meant for all who want to gain a better understanding of what is happening and concerns primarily (a) the way money is recycled through the banking system or the capital market, (b) the products and conduct of the banking, securities and investment industry in this recycling activity, (c) the risks that are taken in the financial services industry (primarily by commercial and investment banks in their different functions) and the tools of risk management, (d) the operation of the financial markets and their infrastructure, (e) the type of regulation of commercial banks and of the intermediaries and issuers in the capital markets, and (f) the objectives, role, shape and effectiveness of this regulation. In this connection, the course will also deal with the smooth operation of payment systems. Financial risk and its management is an important theme and the major concern in the course. What can commercial or investment banks and financial regulation achieve in this regard, how is risk management structured, and what academic or other (political) models are used in this connection, how effective are they, e.g. in the capital adequacy and liquidity requirements, and what can or must governments and/or central banks or other regulators do when all fails and financial crises occur? From a legal point of view, an important aspect is the strong public policy undercurrents in the applicable law. That is obvious in regulation but may also impact on private law. Another important issuer is that the law applicable to financial products and their regulation is ever more transnationalised and expressed at the international level, especially in terms of transactional and payment finality, financial stability, and even banking resolution facilities or international safety nets. In these circumstances, choice of national laws in the older private international law approach often mean little and it will be discussed how they may fall seriously short especially in in matters of regulatory oversight and bankruptcy situations.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","Preclusion":"LL4298V/LL5298V/LL6298V International Finance","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening","Monday Evening","Friday Afternoon"]},{"ModuleCode":"LL5309V","ModuleTitle":"The Practical Realities of Dispute Resolution in Asia","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"Litigation, Arbitration and Mediation are three forms of resolving commercial disputes.

These include a multitude of factors, such as legal considerations, the quantity of funding required and cost of capital depending on its source, and impact on shareholders and management etc. Corporations may also obtain finance by either levering existing assets or resorting to unsecured bank lending or bond issues. For the biggest corporations the most important source of finance tends to be the capital markets. These normally comprise the debt and equity markets through which public companies can offer securities to investors or to transfer the control of the company to new owners in the context of an agreed takeover, a hostile take-over bid, or of a private equity transaction. This course aims to develop a critical understanding of the subject matter through the combined study of finance theory, corporate law, capital market regulation and the corporate market dynamics, with a special focus on the different stakeholders involved in corporate finance. The module will focus on critical corporate finance issues such as: the use of debt and equity; why merge or acquire a business; core considerations of the process; purchase sale agreements and contractual governance; the role of the board of directors in an acquisition/financing transaction; the permissibility and regulation of takeover defenses in the UK, the US and the EU. It will also discuss cross-border IPOS, the problem of market abuse, theory and practice of corporate takeovers and their regulation, and issues pertinent to private equity transactions, as well practical issues relating to structuring corporate acquisition deals and attendant legal documentation.

It is meant for all who want to gain a better understanding of what is happening and concerns primarily (a) the way money is recycled through the banking system or the capital market, (b) the products and conduct of the banking, securities and investment industry in this recycling activity, (c) the risks that are taken in the financial services industry (primarily by commercial and investment banks in their different functions) and the tools of risk management, (d) the operation of the financial markets and their infrastructure, (e) the type of regulation of commercial banks and of the intermediaries and issuers in the capital markets, and (f) the objectives, role, shape and effectiveness of this regulation. In this connection, the course will also deal with the smooth operation of payment systems. Financial risk and its management is an important theme and the major concern in the course. What can commercial or investment banks and financial regulation achieve in this regard, how is risk management structured, and what academic or other (political) models are used in this connection, how effective are they, e.g. in the capital adequacy and liquidity requirements, and what can or must governments and/or central banks or other regulators do when all fails and financial crises occur? From a legal point of view, an important aspect is the strong public policy undercurrents in the applicable law. That is obvious in regulation but may also impact on private law. Another important issuer is that the law applicable to financial products and their regulation is ever more transnationalised and expressed at the international level, especially in terms of transactional and payment finality, financial stability, and even banking resolution facilities or international safety nets. In these circumstances, choice of national laws in the older private international law approach often mean little and it will be discussed how they may fall seriously short especially in in matters of regulatory oversight and bankruptcy situations.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","Preclusion":"LL4298V/LL5298V/LL6298V International Finance","LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening","Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Evening"]},{"ModuleCode":"LL6309V","ModuleTitle":"The Practical Realities of Dispute Resolution in Asia","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"Litigation, Arbitration and Mediation are three forms of resolving commercial disputes.

However, human behavior often deviates from standard assumptions due to psychological and social factors; analysis based on traditional economics can therefore misinform policies and lead to detrimental consequences. This course discusses behavioral regularities that are of potential importance for public policy. Students will be exposed to behavioral economic theory and its applications to public policy in the areas of savings, investment, healthcare, climate change, taxation, labor supply, and monetary policy.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"PP5101 Economics and Public Policy I, or PP5301 Economic Reasoning and Policy, or PP5501 Economic Applications for Public Organisations","LecturePeriods":["Friday Morning"]},{"ModuleCode":"PP5216","ModuleTitle":"Economic Growth in Developing Asia","Department":"Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public Policy","ModuleDescription":"The module provides a comprehensive view with rigorous comparative analyses that are essential for understanding the dynamics of economic growth in developing Asia.

It examines the relationships between population health and development issues, and the different approaches and methods of social policy utilized to compare present and future health and population-related challenges. Past experiences of population growth, movement and decline and the longer term effects on health and related sectors will also be studied with their policy implications. The course takes a systematic life-cycle approach and is a practice-based and policy-oriented module. The practical applications of public health and population sciences are thus employed to the organization of public programs to meet the needs of specific population agegroups. In practice, existing government departments in Ministries of Health or Ministries of Social Welfare have been organized to deliver social services by age-groups - from birth to death across childhood, youth, adulthood and old age.

However, considering the fact that such an intense fascination with Asianism is of a more recent origin a number of important questions are raised. How has the state attempted to convey Asia as a natural and unproblematic an entity? How is knowledge about it influenced and conditioned by changing social, political, and economic forces? Why did Singapore at its earliest historical phase seek to dissociate itself with the region, only to openly embrace it a few decades later? This module, therefore, introduces students to critical ways of challenging and contesting what is understood by the term Asia. Is it a geographical region, a political and cultural construction, or transnationalized space? In particular it provides students the theoretical tools needed to grapple with these questions, introduces cultural texts that could be used in assessing the way Asia is represented, and gives students opportunities for fieldwork and other out of classroom activities.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-3-3","Types":["Module"],"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]},{"ModuleCode":"USP3510","ModuleTitle":"Reason, Secularization & Multiculturalism","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This module investigates three inter-connected questions: Can science prove that religion is irrational?

It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers.
